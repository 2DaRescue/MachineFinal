we observed that some of our missclassification of the dog breed was because of the differnet kind of breeds 
under the same umbrela.. for example
    multiple different kind of terreiers. scottiish terrier and norweigian terriers.
because of this i think our accuracy is lower that is should be. The terrier is just one example. there are multple breeds
that have different variations and this will be somthing to explore at a later date. 

there were somthinggs that we could not include into our presentation due to time contraits. 
somthings that we tried but did not work. 	
multi-batch learning and combining models. First, we tried implementing multi-batch learning, 
where each batch was trained on a subset of dog breeds using different models.
12 models with each model focused on 10 breeds. While the individual 
models trained successfully, combining them into a  ensemble model was hard.. 

in both technique we found that the accuracy would be .0001. 
something would go teribly wrong and we cound not overcome this

this was a huge effort and one of the hardent assignemnts in our college carreer 

we have more files on a git hub account that contains all the models that were failues. from 5% to 60% to our current model at 77ish%

this is somthing that we are willing to continue work on every now and then as a personal project.
